            <p>I grew up with a passion for solving puzzles, my favorite is <a id="vid-link" href="https://youtu.be/IXA0oV4Lwu8">codeword puzzles</a>. I'm sure you know it's cousin the infamous word search but those were never as challenging despite whether they were really big or not. Hence I opted to master the codeword puzzle which I have.</p>
            </p>Back when I started there were no soft copy versions of the game. I had to buy them, can you imagine? Gone are those days as they are all over the internet mostly for free. It's amazing to see how access to something as little as a codeword puzzle has now become much easier to source thanks to the tech evolution. Technology has with no doubt sky rocketed and it continues it's journey.
