    I'm most excited by the tech evolution, tech continues to grow and it brings great thrill to be part of that evolution. On the other hand, it's scary to fathom life without tech. My first hands on experience with computer technology was back when I was 15, at that point I was introduced to Information Technology. I have always been inspired by my Uncle who worked for Dell, he encouraged me to take tech seriously.</p>
            <p id="paragraph2">Puzzles I enjoy and my favourites are <strong>Codeword puzzles</strong>, shout out to all the code word puzzle fans. I started off buying those code word puzzle books, Crosswords never brought much of a challenge so I'd rather something that gives my brain a good workout. As time progressed, there are now apps with these glorious brain exercises, of course by then I was an expert hence I always opt for the highest difficulty as it tickles my fancy.
